### Batch File Renamer
<i>A simple program to rename a directory of files according to a style the user selects.</i>

    <summary>Overview</summary>
    <ul><br>
        A recent migration from Windows to Linux inspired a change in preference towards file naming conventions, and a program that could quickly update the filenames of an entire directory of files seemed like a good project to refine C# competency outside of game development. The aim of this project is thus to gain practical experience working with files in .NET, as well as improve techniques for designing program infrastructure.
        <br><br>
		This program is intended to provide the user with the ability to rename a given directory of files according to one of three styles: all words lowercased, all words uppercased, or first letter of each word uppercased. The user can optionally choose the way spacing between words is handled, choosing from white space, dash, or underscore.
        <br><br>
        Note: project is currently at an early stage in development. Future revisions will see changes to infrastructure and successive implementation of features.
